/// Introduces a ***[Neu]morphic***, or *new [skeuomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeuomorph)*,
/// helper class with a variety of static and instance methods for the simple
/// generation of shaded decorations conforming to the neumorphic design
/// concept.
///
/// ---
///
/// These designs are often solid in terms of color variety: genreally a
/// **dominant color** is used as a backdrop as well as the color of controls
/// and elements. These items that typically appear **on** or "above" the
/// surface in standard design systems are intended in skeumorphism to extrude
/// **from** or "rise out" or into the surface.
///
/// This extrusion, which can be imagined as *clay*- or *rubber*-like, is
/// achieved by a combination of same-color elements and background, contrasting
/// shadows, slight variances in color shading and (potentially) gradients for
/// the impression of **natural lighting**.
///
/// Instantiate a [new Neu] object with desired values then return its
/// decoration properties as getters in the format `buildFooDecoration`; or opt
/// to skip instantiation and directly call [Neu] static methods such as
/// [Neu.boxDecoration].
///
/// A [new Neu.toggle] can be setup to automate the changing of appearance based
/// on a state flag, `isToggled`.
///
/// A [NeuContainer] makes deploying a *[Neu]morphic* design element "as easy
/// as pie." A similar container widget that instead makes use of [Neu.toggle]
/// is [NeuToggle].
///
